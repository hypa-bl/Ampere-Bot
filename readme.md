# Ampere bot.

---------
**coded in discord.js**

Ampere is able to :
* Do basic commands, reactions and other fun stuff
* List characters from the Second Sky Project.

Ampere stores more than half of its commands in separate files.
There are different folders that are categorised on how each command is executed. 
Other commands that I haven't figured out how to store and use dynamically are still present in the main file ampere.js
